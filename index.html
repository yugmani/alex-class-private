  <h1>Private Class Fields and Methods in JavaScript Classes</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The class properties and methods in JavaScript class are by default always
      public. i.e. they are publicly accessible and modifiable.
    </li>
    <li>
      The private methods can be handy when we want to make class properties and
      methods inaccessible from the outside of the class they are defined in.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Keeping Private</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Keeping something private</strong>, be it a property or
          method, it should be accessible only from one place that is the class
          in which we have defined that property or method.
        </li>
        <li>
          If someone tries to access private class field/properties or methods
          from elsewhere JavaScript should not allow it. This includes outside
          the class in which the class field or method is defined and even any
          instance of that class.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, it is possible to access private class field from a method
          inside the same class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Syntax: To declare some class field or method as private we have to
          prefix it with #( the hashtag symbol).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Creating class fields and accessing them with methods</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Declare a private class field by adding prefix the name of the class
          field with #. At the time of accessing that private class field, we
          have to include the #.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two options to access class fields with methods:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>
              Create new instance of that class and access the property on that
              instance. And
            </li>
            <li>
              Declare that property as a static property. In this case, we don't
              need to instantiate the class to access the property.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Private class fields are designed to be inaccessible from the outside.
          To overcome from this, create a new method and return the private
          class field from that method. We can define this method either as
          public or static.
        </li>
        <li>
          Same as with static properties, we can call static methods without
          instantiating the class. If the method is declared as public, we have
          to instantiate the class. And then we will be able to call that method
          on your new instance and get the value of private field.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Updating private class fields with methods</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Same as in creating private class fields, we can modify them as well
          through method.
        </li>
        <li>
          To modify and access the private class field, these methods will be
          available for us to call from the outside.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Setters and Getters with Private Class Fields</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Now, we are sure that the private class fields are inaccessible from
          the outside.
        </li>
        <li>Therefore, getter and setter accessors are useless.</li>
        <li>
          If you try to access, or modify private class field from the outside,
          JavaScript throws error whether there is a setter and/or getter or
          not.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Private Static Class Fields</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Accessing private class field with static method is more complicated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Public class fields and methods are accessible only through class
          instances. They are not accessible through the classes themselves. So,
          if you create a static method to access private class field,
          JavaScript will throw error.
        </li>
        <li>
          One way to overcome from this problem is to declare the private field
          as static as well. Now, you can access the static private class field
          through a static method without instantiating the class.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Private Class Fields and Subclasses</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We already know that both private class field and method are
          accessible only from the inside of the class in which they are
          defined.
        </li>
        <li>This also means that they will be inaccessible for subclasses.</li>
        <li>
          This applies to both public as well as static private class field.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Private Methods</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Same as private class fields, we can create private methods and same
          rules of private class fields apply for private methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          These private methods are accessible only from the inside of the class
          in which they are defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          To call private method from outside, we create a new public method and
          call the private method inside of it.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
